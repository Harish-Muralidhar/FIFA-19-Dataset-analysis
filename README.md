# Process summary

[Code](https://github.com/Harish-Muralidhar/FIFA-19-Dataset-analysis/tree/main/FIFA-19-Dataset-analysis/Code) 

The Dataset considered is of football players with many attribute columns from FIFA 2019. The Preprocessing involves removing columns which are not needed for analysis, removing unwanted symbols, removing null values and feature scaling.
Analysis and Visualization includes the data and plots which can help a football manager to take decisions. They are as follows
1. Finding the attributes or columns with highest correlation and plotting those attributes
2. Determining the change in market value and overall rating of players with age
3. Analyzing top 10 best players in each position, their average market value and average overall rating and Visualizing them appropriately
4. Analyzing 10 least worthy players in each position, their average market value and average overall rating and Visualizing them appropriately
5. KMeans clustering is used to cluster based on highest correlated columns computed above with respect to position and subplots for each cluster is plotted. Also Cluster centers and prediction columns are displayed
